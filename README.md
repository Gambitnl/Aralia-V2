# Aralia RPG

Welcome to Aralia RPG!

This is a text-based fantasy role-playing game powered by the Google Gemini API, where your choices shape the adventure in the world of Aralia.

## Getting Started

For a detailed overview of the project, core features, technology stack, project structure, and development practices, please see our main documentation hub:

➡️ **[Project Overview & Documentation](./docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.README.md)**

To quickly find specific documentation files, refer to the [Documentation Index](./docs/README_INDEX.md).

## Running the Application
1.  Ensure you have a modern web browser.
2.  Set up your Gemini API key as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
    *   If running locally, you might need a simple HTTP server for ES module imports to work correctly (e.g., using `npx http-server .` or VS Code Live Server).
