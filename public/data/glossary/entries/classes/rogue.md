Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.

Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

  <div>
    <p>You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack</span>’s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before rolling.</p>
    <p>If a Cunning Strike effect requires a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>.</p>

      <li><strong>Trip (Cost: 1d6).</strong> If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> or have the <span data-term-id="prone_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Prone condition</span>.</li>
