Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.

Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.

Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

<details id="level-1-spellcasting-druid">
  <summary>Level 1: Spellcasting</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You have learned to cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> by communing with nature. See “<span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spells</span>” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description.</p>
    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Thorn Whip are recommended.</p>
    <p>Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.</p>
    <p>When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.</p>
    <p><strong><span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Slots</span>.</strong> The Druid Features table shows how many <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> you have to cast your level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>. You regain all expended slots when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> from the Druid spell list. Cure Wounds, Entangle, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.</p>
    <p>The number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> from the Druid spell list until the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> must be of a level for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> can include six <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.</p>
    <p>If another Druid feature gives you <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that you always have prepared, those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> don’t count against the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you can prepare with this feature, but those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> otherwise count as Druid <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> for you.</p>
    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you can change your list of prepared <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>, replacing any of the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> there with other Druid <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>
    <p><strong><span data-term-id="spellcasting_focus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spellcasting Focus</span>.</strong> You can use a Druidic Focus as a <span data-term-id="spellcasting_focus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spellcasting Focus</span> for your Druid <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>

<details id="level-1-druidic">
  <summary>Level 1: Druidic</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>

<details id="level-1-primal-order">
  <summary>Level 1: Primal Order</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.</p>
    <p><strong>Warden.</strong> Trained for battle, you gain <span data-term-id="proficiency" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">proficiency</span> with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.</p>
    <p><strong>Magician.</strong> You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details id="level-2-wild-shape">
  <summary>Level 2: Wild Shape</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You can use your magic to magically assume the shape of a Beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short</span> or <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.</p>
    <p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level (round down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall <span data-term-id="unconscious_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unconscious</span>, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die.</p>
    <p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your Alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all your <span data-term-id="proficiency" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> and <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>
      <li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s Hit Points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 Hit Point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you aren’t knocked <span data-term-id="unconscious_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unconscious</span>.</li>
      <li>You can’t cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>, and your ability to speak or take any <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span> on a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">actions</span> that are part of a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>, such as Call Lightning, that you’ve already cast.</li>
      <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as <span data-term-id="darkvision" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkvision</span>, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
      <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
    </ul>

## Druid Subclass
A Druid subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels, as specified in the subclass. Druids form loose associations, which they call circles. This section presents the Circle of the Land subclass.

### Circle of the Land
Celebrate Connection to the Natural World

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

The <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.</p>

At Druid levels 3, 5, 7, and 9, you gain access to circle <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> connected to the land where you became a Druid. Choose one of the following land types: Arctic, Coast, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark.</p>
    <p>Once you gain access to a circle <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you can prepare each day.
