Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.

Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.

Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.

Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

  <div>
    <p>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike and Monk weapons, which are the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple Melee weapons</li>
      <li>Martial Melee weapons that have the Light property</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.</p>
    <p><strong>Bonus Unarmed Strike.</strong> You can make an Unarmed Strike as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>.</p>

<details id="level-2-monks-focus">
  <summary>Level 2: Monk’s Focus</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by <strong>Focus Points</strong> (often called Ki Points in other editions). Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk Features table.</p>
    <p>You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.</p>
    <p>When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short</span> or <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.</p>
    <p>Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Flurry of Blows.</strong> You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Patient Defense.</strong> You can take the <span data-term-id="disengage_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disengage action</span> as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>.

The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.</p>
    <p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force.
