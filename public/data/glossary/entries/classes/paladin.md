Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

<details id="level-1-spellcasting-paladin">
  <summary>Level 1: Spellcasting</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You have learned to cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> through prayer and meditation. See “<span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spells</span>” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class’s description.</p>
    <p><strong><span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Slots</span>.</strong> The Paladin Features table shows how many <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> you have to cast your level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>. You regain all expended slots when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended.</p>
    <p>The number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> until the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> must be of a level for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> can include six Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> of level 1 or 2 in any combination.</p>
    <p>If another Paladin feature gives you <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that you always have prepared, those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> don’t count against the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you can prepare with this feature, but those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> otherwise count as Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> for you.</p>
    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you can replace one <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> on your list with another Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>
    <p><strong><span data-term-id="spellcasting_focus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spellcasting Focus</span>.</strong> You can use a Holy Symbol as a <span data-term-id="spellcasting_focus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spellcasting Focus</span> for your Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>

<details id="level-3-channel-divinity-paladin">
  <summary>Level 3: Channel Divinity</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.</p>
    <p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short Rest</span>, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.</p>
    <p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.</p>
    <p><strong>Divine Sense.</strong> As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.</p>

<details id="level-3-paladin-subclass">
  <summary>Level 3: Paladin Subclass</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.</p>
    <p><strong>Breaking Your Oath.</strong> A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath. A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh. If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.</p>

## Paladin Subclass
A Paladin subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Oath of Devotion subclass.

This subclass represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts.

### Oath of Devotion
Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

These paladins share the following tenets:
*   Let your word be your promise.
*   Protect the weak and never fear to act.
*   Let your honorable deeds be an example.
