Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

  <summary>Level 1: Spellcasting</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You have learned to cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> through prayer and meditation. See “<span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spells</span>” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class’s description.</p>
    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance, Sacred Flame, and Thaumaturgy are recommended.</p>
    <p>Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.</p>
    <p>When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.</p>
    <p><strong><span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Slots</span>.</strong> The Cleric Features table shows how many <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> you have to cast your level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>. You regain all expended slots when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.</p>
    <p>The number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> from the Cleric spell list until the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> must be of a level for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> can include six <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.</p>
    <p>If another Cleric feature gives you <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that you always have prepared, those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> don’t count against the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you can prepare with this feature, but those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> otherwise count as Cleric <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> for you.</p>
    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you can change your list of prepared <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>, replacing any of the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> there with other Cleric <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use a Holy Symbol as a <span data-term-id="spellcasting_focus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spellcasting Focus</span> for your Cleric <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Level 1: Divine Order</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.</p>
    <p><strong>Protector.</strong> Trained for battle, you gain <span data-term-id="proficiency" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">proficiency</span> with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.</p>
    <p><strong>Thaumaturge.</strong> You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Level 2: Channel Divinity</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.</p>
    <p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short Rest</span>, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.</p>
    <p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.</p>
    <p><strong>Divine Spark.</strong> As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).</p>
    <p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p>
    <p><strong>Turn Undead.</strong> As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>. If the creature fails its save, it has the <span data-term-id="frightened_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Frightened</span> and <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated</span> conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>, or if you die.</p>

## Cleric Subclass
A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, pantheon, or religious order. This section presents the Life Domain subclass.

### Life Domain
Soothe the Hurts of the World

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

  <summary>Level 3: Preserve Life</summary>
  <div>
    <p>As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Level 6: Blessed Healer</summary>
  <div>
    <p>The healing <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> with a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>’s level.</p>

  <div>
    <p>When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>, you restore 12.</p>
