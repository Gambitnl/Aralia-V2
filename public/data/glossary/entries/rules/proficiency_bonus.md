# Proficiency Bonus

All creatures have a **Proficiency Bonus**, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in “Creating a Character”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its <span data-term-id="challenge_rating" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Challenge Rating</span> (see the Rules Glossary). The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.

This bonus is applied to a <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span> when the creature has <span data-term-id="proficiency" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">proficiency</span> in a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, in a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, or with an item that the creature uses to make the <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span>. The bonus is also used for <span data-term-id="spell_attack" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell attacks</span> and for calculating the DC of <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throws</span> for <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.

## Proficiency Bonus Table
| Level or CR | Bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| Up to 4     | +2    |
| 5–8         | +3    |
| 9–12        | +4    |
| 13–16       | +5    |
| 17–20       | +6    |
| 21–24       | +7    |
| 25–28       | +8    |
| 29–30       | +9    |

## The Bonus Doesn’t Stack
Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you’re proficient in either <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, but you don’t add it twice if you’re proficient in both <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skills</span>.

Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the <span data-term-id="expertise" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Expertise</span> feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span>. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.
