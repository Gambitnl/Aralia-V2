# Spells (Chapter Overview)

This section provides a general overview of how spells work in the game. Spells can range from simple cantrips that can be cast at will to powerful incantations that can reshape reality. Understanding the fundamentals of spellcasting is crucial for any character who wields magic.

Key aspects of spellcasting include:

*   **Gaining and Preparing Spells**: How characters learn spells and make them ready for casting.
*   **Spell Levels and Slots**: The power level of spells and the resources required to cast them.
*   **Schools of Magic**: The different categories or types of magic.
*   **Casting Time**: How long it takes to cast a spell.
*   **Range**: How far a spell's effects can reach.
*   **Components**: The verbal, somatic, and material requirements for casting.
*   **Duration**: How long a spell's effects last.
*   **Effects**: What a spell does, including targeting, saving throws, and attack rolls.

For detailed rules on each of these aspects, please refer to the specific entries under the **Spellcasting Mechanics** category in this glossary.

> You must have training with any armor you are wearing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise too hampered by the armor for spellcasting.
