# Proficiency

Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many <span data-term-id="weapons" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">weapons</span>, while others can use only a few. Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities.

This bonus is applied to a <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span> when the creature has proficiency in a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, in a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, or with an item (like a <span data-term-id="weapons" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">weapon</span> or <span data-term-id="tools" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">tool</span>) that the creature uses to make the <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span>. The bonus is also used for <span data-term-id="spell_attack" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell attacks</span> and for calculating the DC of <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throws</span> for <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.

**The Bonus Doesn’t Stack**
Your <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> can’t be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> if you’re proficient in either <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, but you don’t add it twice if you’re proficient in both <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skills</span>.

Occasionally, a <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the <span data-term-id="expertise" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Expertise</span> feature doubles the <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> for certain <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span>. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.

## Skill Proficiencies
Most <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span> involve using a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span>. The descriptions of the <span data-term-id="actions_in_combat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">actions</span> you take specify which <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> applies if you make an <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span> for that <span data-term-id="actions_in_combat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span>, and many other rules note when a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> is relevant in a situation.

If a creature is proficient in a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, the creature applies its <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span> involving that <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>. Without proficiency in a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, a creature can still make <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span> involving that <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> but doesn’t add its <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>.

### Skill List
The <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skills</span> are shown on the Skills table, which notes example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span> the skill most often applies to.

**Determining Skills**
A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.

**Skills with Different Abilities**
Each skill proficiency is associated with an <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span>. For example, the Intimidation skill is associated with Charisma. In some situations, the DM might allow you to apply your skill proficiency to a different <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span>. For example, if a character tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check rather than a Charisma (Intimidation) check. That character would make a Strength check and add their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> if they have Intimidation proficiency.

## Saving Throw Proficiencies
Proficiency in a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> lets a character add their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span> that use a particular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span> lets you add your <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to your Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span>. Some monsters also have <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throws</span>, representing that class’s training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span>; they train to resist mental assault.

## Equipment Proficiencies
A character gains proficiency with various <span data-term-id="weapons" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">weapons</span> and <span data-term-id="tools" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">tools</span> from their class and background. There are two categories of equipment proficiency:

*   **Weapons**: Anyone can wield a <span data-term-id="weapons" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">weapon</span>, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a <span data-term-id="weapons" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">weapon</span>, you add your <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span> you make with it.
*   **Tools**: If you have proficiency with a <span data-term-id="tools" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">tool</span>, you can add your <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to any <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span> you make that uses the <span data-term-id="tools" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">tool</span>. If you have proficiency in the <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> that’s also used with that check, you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on the check too. This means you can benefit from both <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> proficiency and <span data-term-id="tools" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">tool</span> proficiency on the same <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span>.
